## Phase 2: Transcript Capture Validation

### Step 6: Enable Transcription

**Purpose**: Verify transcripts are being captured in real-time

1. **Start Session**:
   - Instructor and student in same classroom
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Check for transcription initialization logs

2. **Speak into Microphone**:
   - **Instructor says**: "Today we'll learn about calculus derivatives"
   - Wait 2-3 seconds
   - **Student says**: "Okay, I'm ready to learn"

3. **Check Transcripts via API**:
   ```bash
   # In a new terminal (server must be running)
   curl "http://localhost:3000/api/transcripts/classroom-01"
   ```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "entries": [
    {
      "id": "session-...",
      "sessionId": "classroom-01",
      "speakerId": "participant-...",
      "speakerRole": "instructor",
      "speakerName": "Test Instructor",
      "text": "Today we'll learn about calculus derivatives",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-07T...",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "breakoutRoomName": null
    },
    {
      "id": "session-...",
      "sessionId": "classroom-01",
      "speakerId": "participant-...",
      "speakerRole": "student",
      "speakerName": "Test Student",
      "text": "Okay, I'm ready to learn",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-07T...",
      "confidence": 0.92,
      "breakoutRoomName": null
    }
  ],
  "count": 2,
  "hasMore": false
}
```

**Validation**:
- [ ] Transcripts captured for both speakers
- [ ] Speaker roles correct (instructor vs student)
- [ ] Timestamps in chronological order
- [ ] Confidence scores reasonable (>0.7)
- [ ] Text matches what was said (approximately)

**Troubleshooting**:
- If empty response: Check microphone permissions in browser
- If low confidence: Check microphone quality, speak clearly
- If wrong role: Check participant join logic assigns role correctly

### Step 7: Test Transcript Filtering

```bash
# Get only instructor transcripts
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/transcripts/classroom-01?role=instructor"

# Get only student transcripts
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/transcripts/classroom-01?role=student"

# Get recent transcripts (since 1 minute ago)
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/transcripts/classroom-01?since=2025-10-07T14:30:00Z"
```

**Validation**:
- [ ] Role filtering works correctly
- [ ] Time filtering works correctly
- [ ] High-confidence filter works (`minConfidence` parameter)

---

## Phase 3: Help Detection & Alerts Validation

### Step 8: Trigger Help Alert

**Purpose**: Verify system detects student confusion and alerts instructor

1. **Create Breakout Room**:
   - As instructor, create "Test Group" breakout room
   - Assign student to breakout room
   - Student joins breakout room

2. **Student Expresses Confusion**:
   - **Student says**: "I don't understand derivatives"
   - Wait 5 seconds for analysis

3. **Check for Alert via API**:
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:3000/api/alerts/classroom-01?status=pending"
   ```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "alerts": [
    {
      "id": "alert-...",
      "classroomSessionId": "classroom-01",
      "breakoutRoomSessionId": "breakout-room-...",
      "breakoutRoomName": "Test Group",
      "detectedAt": "2025-10-07T...",
      "topic": "derivatives",
      "urgency": "medium",
      "triggerKeywords": ["don't understand"],
      "contextSnippet": "Student: I don't understand derivatives",
      "status": "pending",
      "acknowledgedBy": null,
      "acknowledgedAt": null,
      "sourceTranscriptIds": ["..."]
    }
  ],
  "counts": {
    "pending": 1,
    "acknowledged": 0,
    "resolved": 0,
    "dismissed": 0
  }
}
```

**Validation**:
- [ ] Alert created within 5 seconds of student speaking
- [ ] Topic extracted correctly ("derivatives")
- [ ] Urgency calculated appropriately (medium)
- [ ] Breakout room name included
- [ ] Trigger keywords identified

### Step 9: Test Different Help Patterns

**Purpose**: Verify various confusion indicators trigger alerts

Speak the following phrases and check for alerts:

| Student Says | Expected Urgency | Expected Topic |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| "I'm stuck on this problem" | High | (last mentioned concept) |
| "Can you explain that again?" | Low | (last instructor topic) |
| "This is too hard" | High | (current topic) |
| "I'm confused about integrals" | Medium | "integrals" |

**Validation**:
- [ ] All phrases trigger alerts
- [ ] Urgency levels match expectations
- [ ] Topics extracted correctly
- [ ] No false positives (saying "I understand" doesn't trigger)

### Step 10: Test Alert Management

**Purpose**: Verify instructor can manage alerts

1. **Acknowledge Alert**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/alerts \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "alertId": "alert-...",
       "status": "acknowledged",
       "instructorId": "instructor-test-instructor"
     }'
   ```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "alert": {
    "id": "alert-...",
    "status": "acknowledged",
    "acknowledgedBy": "instructor-test-instructor",
    "acknowledgedAt": "2025-10-07T..."
  },
  "message": "Alert acknowledged successfully"
}
```

2. **Resolve Alert**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/alerts \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "alertId": "alert-...",
       "status": "resolved",
       "instructorId": "instructor-test-instructor"
     }'
   ```

**Validation**:
- [ ] Can acknowledge alerts
- [ ] Can resolve alerts
- [ ] Can dismiss alerts
- [ ] Status transitions work correctly
- [ ] Timestamps updated appropriately

### Step 11: Test Alert UI (If Implemented)

**Purpose**: Verify instructor sees alerts in UI

1. **Check Instructor Dashboard**:
   - As instructor, look for AlertPanel component
   - Should see pending alerts

**Validation**:
- [ ] Alerts appear in UI automatically (via polling or SSE)
- [ ] Alerts sorted by urgency (high first)
- [ ] Can click to acknowledge/resolve
- [ ] UI updates when status changes
- [ ] Sound/visual indicator for new alerts (if implemented)

---

## Phase 4: Quiz Generation Validation

### Step 12: Generate Quiz from Instructor Speech

**Purpose**: Verify LLM generates quality quiz questions

1. **Instructor Teaches Content**:
   - **Instructor says**: "The derivative of x squared is 2x. This comes from the power rule, where we bring down the exponent and reduce the power by one. The derivative of a constant is always zero because constants don't change."
   - Wait for transcripts to be captured

2. **Request Quiz Generation**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/quiz/generate \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "sessionId": "classroom-01",
       "instructorId": "instructor-test-instructor",
       "questionCount": 5,
       "difficulty": "mixed"
     }'
   ```

**Expected Response** (within 30 seconds):
```json
{
  "quiz": {
    "id": "quiz-classroom-01-...",
    "sessionId": "classroom-01",
    "createdBy": "instructor-test-instructor",
    "createdByName": "Test Instructor",
    "createdAt": "2025-10-07T...",
    "lastModified": "2025-10-07T...",

        "id": "quiz-...-q0",
        "type": "multiple_choice",
        "question": "What is the derivative of x^2?",
        "options": ["x", "2x", "x^2", "2"],
        "correctAnswer": "B",
        "explanation": "Using the power rule: bring down the exponent (2) and reduce the power by 1, giving 2x",
        "difficulty": "easy",
        "sourceTranscriptIds": ["..."]
      },
      {
        "id": "quiz-...-q1",
        "type": "true_false",
        "question": "The derivative of a constant is always zero.",
        "options": null,
        "correctAnswer": true,
        "explanation": "Constants have no rate of change, so their derivative is 0",
        "difficulty": "easy",
        "sourceTranscriptIds": ["..."]
      }
      // ... 3 more questions
    ],
    "status": "draft",
    "title": "Derivatives Basics"
