# Feature Specification: Intelligent Education Video Platform

**Feature Branch**: `003-this-is-a`  
**Created**: October 7, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "This is a working zoom alternative using the daily js api. I need to get it running locally on my machine by seeting up my env variables and my api key. My goal is to create features that make this a groundbreaking education video platform with features like analyzing transcripts and chats in breakout rooms to alert the instructor when help is needed (given the instructor a heads up on what theyre struggling with). Features like creating pop quiz questions based on the transcript from the instructor (only the instructor) and more"

- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-07
- Q: Which data protection regulations must the system comply with? ‚Üí A: FERPA (accelerator environment, lower privacy priority)
- Q: How should the system distinguish between instructor and student speech? ‚Üí A: Role-based (assigned when joining - instructor/student tag)
- Q: How long should the system retain transcripts, recordings, and session data? ‚Üí A: 90 days (when data storage implemented; initial version runs locally without database using pre-defined Daily URLs)
- Q: How should instructors receive help alerts from breakout rooms? ‚Üí A: In-app only (notifications within the video platform UI)
- Q: What types of quiz questions should the system generate from instructor transcripts? ‚Üí A: Multiple choice + True/False

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An instructor hosts a virtual classroom session with multiple students. During the session, students can be split into breakout rooms for group work. The system automatically monitors conversations and transcripts in these breakout rooms, identifying when students are struggling with concepts. The instructor receives intelligent alerts that summarize what help is needed, allowing them to intervene proactively. Additionally, the instructor can leverage their own teaching content to automatically generate relevant quiz questions, reinforcing key concepts without manual quiz creation.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Setup and Configuration
1. **Given** a developer wants to run the platform locally, **When** they follow the setup documentation, **Then** they can successfully configure environment variables and API keys to launch the application

#### Scenario 2: Breakout Room Help Detection
1. **Given** an instructor has created breakout rooms with students, **When** students in a breakout room express confusion or struggle with a concept (via chat or voice), **Then** the instructor receives an alert highlighting which room needs help and what topic they're struggling with

2. **Given** multiple breakout rooms are active simultaneously, **When** students in different rooms need help, **Then** alerts are prioritized and grouped intelligently for the instructor to triage

#### Scenario 3: Automatic Quiz Generation
1. **Given** an instructor has been teaching and their transcript has been captured, **When** the instructor requests quiz generation, **Then** the system creates relevant quiz questions based only on the instructor's spoken content (not student conversations)

2. **Given** a quiz has been generated, **When** the instructor reviews it, **Then** they can edit, approve, or reject questions before distributing to students

#### Scenario 4: Real-time Transcript Analysis
1. **Given** a live classroom session is in progress, **When** the system captures audio from breakout rooms, **Then** transcripts are generated and analyzed in near real-time for learning assistance opportunities

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a breakout room has no audio activity for an extended period?
- How does the system handle background noise or multiple people speaking simultaneously in breakout rooms?
- What happens if transcript quality is poor or contains errors?
- How does the system differentiate between casual conversation and actual help requests?
- How are alerts managed if an instructor is overwhelmed with multiple simultaneous help requests?
- What happens when the API key or environment is misconfigured?

### Functional Requirements - Transcript Monitoring

- **FR-006**: System MUST analyze transcripts to identify patterns indicating students need help (e.g., confusion keywords, repeated questions, silence patterns)
- **FR-007**: System MUST distinguish between instructor and student speech using role tags assigned when participants join the session
- **FR-008**: System MUST notify participants that sessions are being recorded and transcribed (accelerator context: basic consent notification, explicit opt-in not required)

### Functional Requirements - Chat Monitoring  
- **FR-009**: System MUST monitor text chat within breakout rooms
- **FR-010**: System MUST analyze chat messages for help requests and confusion indicators
- **FR-011**: Chat analysis MUST work in conjunction with transcript analysis to provide complete context

### Functional Requirements - Instructor Alerts
- **FR-012**: System MUST send real-time alerts to instructors when help is needed in breakout rooms
- **FR-013**: Alerts MUST include: which breakout room, what topic/concept students are struggling with, and severity/urgency level [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How is urgency calculated? What factors determine priority?]
- **FR-014**: Instructors MUST be able to customize alert sensitivity and frequency [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What customization options should be available?]

## Clarification Status Summary

### ‚úÖ Resolved (Session 2025-10-07)
1. **Privacy & Compliance**: FERPA (accelerator context, lower privacy priority)
2. **Speaker Identification**: Role-based (assigned when joining)
3. **Data Retention**: 90-day retention when persistent storage implemented; initial version in-memory only with pre-defined Daily URLs
4. **Alert Delivery**: In-app notifications only (within video platform UI)
5. **Quiz Question Types**: Multiple choice + True/False

### üìã Deferred to Planning Phase (Lower Impact)
These can be refined during implementation planning without blocking architectural decisions:
1. **Third-party Services** (FR-004): Beyond Daily.co, identify any additional API integrations needed for transcription/AI analysis
2. **Alert Urgency Calculation** (FR-013): Define algorithm for prioritizing help requests (frequency of confusion keywords, silence duration, explicit help requests)
3. **Alert Customization** (FR-014): Specify instructor configuration options (sensitivity thresholds, alert frequency limits, keyword filters)
4. **Transcript Context Window** (FR-021): Determine optimal transcript history for quiz generation (recommend: entire current session)
5. **Scale Requirements** (FR-026): Define maximum classroom size target (recommend: 50 students initially, scale testing needed)
