# Feature Specification: Instructor Interface Improvements

**Feature Branch**: `004-audio-video-controls`  
**Created**: October 8, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "üéôÔ∏è Audio / Video Controls - Implement mute/unmute self and camera on/off toggle buttons for the instructor view. Each button should clearly show its current state (icon color or text change). Add keyboard shortcuts: M ‚Üí toggle mic, C ‚Üí toggle camera. üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Instructor Controls - Replace the current 'Mute All' and 'Unmute All' buttons with a single toggle button: If anyone is unmuted ‚Üí button reads 'Mute All', If all muted ‚Üí button reads 'Unmute All'. Ensure button updates in real time when participants join/leave. Fix underlying logic so mute/unmute works across all connected participants. button is not currently working. üß© Breakout Room Management - Fix 'Create Breakout' button so that it properly creates sub-rooms using Daily room APIs or internal state mock if not yet integrated. Instructor should see confirmation of creation and list of active breakout groups. Add a simple UI modal for selecting which participants to move into each breakout. current button doesn't appear to be working. üÜò Help Alert System - Replace the current bottom 'Help Alert' area with a modal or floating pop-up in the instructor's view. Should appear immediately help is needed. current location is too hidden for instructor to notice. Include the student's name and timestamp and a summary of the issue. üß† Pop Quiz Functionality - Clarify when and how pop quizzes trigger: Add a small indicator (e.g., 'Quiz pending' or 'Quiz active') near the instructor toolbar. Add a toast or modal when a quiz begins and ends. Add logging/telemetry so instructors can confirm a quiz actually ran. currently i have no way of testing if this is actually working. üí¨ Transcript Feed - Implement a system to handle transcript overflow once more than 10 lines are visible: Persist older entries in memory or backend (depending on current design). Add a scrollback history view or export button ('Download transcript'). ü™≤ Debug & Language Cleanup - Remove all placeholder 'debug' text, console logs, or non-English filler. currently near the live transcript. also need to remove the red box of restarting transcript. Use clear, consistent UI copy for every instructor tool. üîç Video Resizing - Allow instructor to resize video tiles dynamically (drag to resize or choose preset layouts). Maintain responsive design so layouts adapt smoothly between desktop and tablet widths."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-08
- Q: Should transcripts persist between sessions (stored to disk/database) or only exist during the active session (in-memory only)? ‚Üí A: In-memory only ‚Äî transcripts lost when session ends (as long as they can be downloaded during the session)
- Q: What file format(s) should transcript exports use? ‚Üí A: Multiple formats ‚Äî instructor can choose between CSV and JSON
- Q: What is the maximum number of simultaneous breakout rooms that should be supported? ‚Üí A: 1-10 rooms ‚Äî flexible range from single breakout to high flexibility for large classes
- Q: What preset video layouts should be available for instructors? ‚Üí A: Grid + Spotlight layouts; when screen sharing is active, layout should adapt to prioritize shared content (potentially with sidebar for participants)
- Q: Should media control keyboard shortcuts (M for mic, C for camera) work when text input fields have focus? ‚Üí A: Main window only ‚Äî shortcuts disabled when text inputs have focus to prevent accidental triggering while typing
- Q: Should chat functionality be added? ‚Üí A: Yes ‚Äî chat is enabled in Daily config but no UI exists; add chat interface for participants and instructors

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An instructor hosts a live virtual classroom session and needs full control over their own media (microphone and camera), the ability to manage all participants' audio states efficiently, organize students into breakout rooms, communicate via text chat with participants, receive immediate visible notifications when students need help, monitor quiz activity in real time, review complete session transcripts, and customize their video layout to suit their teaching style and screen size. All controls must be intuitive, immediately visible, and provide clear feedback about current states and actions taken.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Personal Media Control
1. **Given** an instructor is in an active classroom session, **When** they click the microphone toggle button or press the 'M' key, **Then** their microphone mutes/unmutes and the button clearly shows the new state through visual indicators (color, icon, or text)
2. **Given** an instructor is in an active classroom session, **When** they click the camera toggle button or press the 'C' key, **Then** their camera turns on/off and the button clearly shows the new state through visual indicators

#### Scenario 2: Bulk Participant Control
1. **Given** multiple students are in a session with varying mute states, **When** the instructor views the participant control button, **Then** it displays "Mute All" if anyone is unmuted or "Unmute All" if everyone is already muted
2. **Given** the instructor clicks the "Mute All" button, **When** the action completes, **Then** all participants are muted and the button immediately changes to "Unmute All"
3. **Given** participants join or leave during a session, **When** the mute states change, **Then** the control button updates in real time to reflect the current aggregate state

#### Scenario 3: Breakout Room Management
1. **Given** an instructor has active participants in the main room, **When** they click "Create Breakout" and select participants for assignment, **Then** the system creates the breakout rooms and shows confirmation with a list of active groups and their members
2. **Given** breakout rooms have been created, **When** the instructor views their interface, **Then** they can see all active breakout groups, who is in each group, and options to manage them

#### Scenario 4: Help Alert Visibility
1. **Given** a student requests help or the system detects confusion in a breakout room, **When** the alert is generated, **Then** a prominent modal or floating notification appears in the instructor's view containing the student's name, timestamp, and a summary of what help is needed
2. **Given** multiple help requests arrive, **When** the instructor is viewing one alert, **Then** they can navigate between pending alerts without losing information

#### Scenario 5: Quiz Activity Monitoring
1. **Given** a quiz is pending or active in the session, **When** the instructor views their toolbar, **Then** a clear status indicator shows "Quiz pending" or "Quiz active" 
2. **Given** a quiz begins or ends, **When** the state changes, **Then** the instructor receives a toast notification or modal confirming the transition with relevant details
3. **Given** quizzes run during a session, **When** the instructor wants to verify quiz activity, **Then** they can access logs or telemetry showing when quizzes started, ended, and participation metrics

#### Scenario 6: Transcript Management
1. **Given** more than 10 lines of transcript are generated, **When** the instructor views the transcript feed, **Then** older entries are preserved (not lost) and the instructor can scroll back through history or export the complete transcript
2. **Given** an instructor wants to review or share session content, **When** they click "Download transcript", **Then** the system provides a complete transcript file

#### Scenario 7: Professional Interface Quality
1. **Given** an instructor is using the platform, **When** they view any interface elements, **Then** all text is in English, professional, and free of debug placeholders or technical jargon
2. **Given** transcription services are working, **When** the instructor views the transcript area, **Then** there are no distracting debug indicators (like red "restarting transcript" boxes)

#### Scenario 8: Flexible Video Layouts
1. **Given** an instructor has multiple video feeds visible, **When** they want to adjust the layout, **Then** they can either drag video tiles to resize them or select from preset layout options
2. **Given** an instructor uses different devices or screen sizes, **When** they access the platform on desktop or tablet, **Then** the video layout adapts responsively while maintaining usability

#### Scenario 9: Text Chat Communication
1. **Given** participants are in an active classroom session, **When** an instructor or student sends a chat message, **Then** the message appears in all participants' chat panels with sender name and timestamp
2. **Given** students are in breakout rooms, **When** they send chat messages, **Then** messages are visible only to breakout room members and the instructor
3. **Given** an instructor has the chat panel closed, **When** new messages arrive, **Then** a notification indicator appears to alert them
4. **Given** keyboard shortcuts are configured (M for mic, C for camera), **When** the chat input field has focus, **Then** typing 'M' or 'C' types the letter instead of triggering media controls

### Edge Cases
- What happens when keyboard shortcuts conflict with browser or OS shortcuts?
- How does the system handle mute/unmute commands when participants have connection issues?
- What happens if breakout room creation fails or reaches platform limits?
- How are help alerts prioritized when multiple students need help simultaneously?
- What happens to quiz indicators if the quiz generation service is unavailable?
- How does transcript export handle sessions with hours of content?
- What happens if the user resizes video tiles beyond readable dimensions?
- How does the interface handle instructors with multiple monitors or non-standard screen ratios?
- How does the layout behave when multiple participants are screen sharing simultaneously?
- What happens to custom layout preferences when screen sharing starts or stops?
- How does chat handle message overflow (hundreds or thousands of messages)?
- What happens to breakout room chat history when rooms are closed or participants move between rooms?
- How are chat notifications handled when instructors are viewing a different interface panel?
