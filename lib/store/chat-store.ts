/**
 * Chat Store
 * 
 * Manages text chat messages scoped by room (main classroom + up to 10 breakout rooms).
 * 
 * WHY room-scoped chat:
 * - Main classroom has one shared chat (visible to all)
 * - Each breakout room has isolated chat (visible only to members + instructor)
 * - Instructor can view/send to any room (monitoring + support)
 * - Students only see their current room's chat
 * 
 * WHY atomFamily pattern:
 * - Each room gets its own independent message array
 * - Rooms are created/destroyed dynamically (1-10 breakout rooms)
 * - atomFamily creates atoms on-demand (keyed by roomId)
 * - Memory efficient: unused rooms don't allocate memory
 * - Cleanup: atoms garbage-collected when no longer referenced
 * 
 * WHY in-memory only:
 * - Chat is ephemeral (session context)
 * - No requirement to persist chat history between sessions
 * - Reduces complexity (no database, no export needed)
 * - Aligns with transcript/quiz storage approach
 * 
 * Memory estimate:
 * - Average message: ~200 bytes (timestamp + sender + text)
 * - Typical session: 100 messages/room Ã— 11 rooms = 220 KB
 * - Acceptable for in-memory (< 1 MB even with heavy usage)
 * 
 * Room ID conventions:
 * - 'main' = main classroom chat
 * - UUID strings = breakout room IDs (e.g., 'breakout-uuid-123')

 * - Simpler serialization (if we add persistence later)

 * - TypeScript Record type is more ergonomic

 * - Increment when message arrives in non-active room
 * - Reset to 0 when user switches to that room (marks as read)
