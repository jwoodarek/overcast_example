# Implement tasks t006 to t010 (2025-10-08 03:01Z)

_**User (2025-10-07 17:59Z)**_

/implement t006-t010

--- Cursor Command: implement.md ---
---
description: Execute the implementation plan by processing and executing all tasks defined in tasks.md
---

The user input can be provided directly by the agent or as a command argument - you **MUST** consider it before proceeding with the prompt (if not empty).

User input:

t006-t010

1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute.

2. Load and analyze the implementation context:
   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan
   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios

3. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:
   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish
   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules
   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]
   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements

4. Execute implementation following the task plan:
   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  
   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks
   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially
   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding

5. Implementation execution rules:
   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration
   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios
   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints
   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services
   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation

6. Progress tracking and error handling:
   - Report progress after each completed task
   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails
   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones
   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging
   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed
   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.

7. Completion validation:
   - Verify all required tasks are completed
   - Check that implemented features match the original specification
   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements
   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan
   - Report final status with summary of completed work

Note: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/tasks` first to regenerate the task list.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to implement tasks t006-t010 from the tasks.md file. Let me start by following the command workflow:

1. First, I need to run the check-prerequisites script to get the FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS
2. Then load and analyze the implementation context
3. Parse tasks.md to understand the tasks
4. Execute the implementation

Let me start by running the prerequisites check script.</details></think>

---

I'll implement tasks t006-t010 from the tasks file. Let me start by checking the prerequisites and loading the necessary context.

---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
cd /Users/jedwoodarek/Projects/overcast_example && .specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks
```

```
{"FEATURE_DIR":"/Users/jedwoodarek/Projects/overcast_example/specs/004-audio-video-controls","AVAILABLE_DOCS":["research.md","data-model.md","contracts/","quickstart.md","tasks.md"]}

```

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good, I have the feature directory and available docs. Now I need to load the required and available documentation files:
- tasks.md (required)
- plan.md (required)
- data-model.md (exists)
- contracts/ (exists)
- research.md (exists)
- quickstart.md (exists)

Let me read these files to understand the context.</details></think>

Now let me load all the necessary context files:

No results found
</details>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good. Now let me analyze what tasks t006-t010 are:

From tasks.md:
- T006 [P] Extend `lib/store/quiz-store.ts` to add activeQuizAtom, quizHistoryAtom, quizTelemetryAtom (lifecycle events)
- T007 [P] Extend `lib/store/transcript-store.ts` to add transcriptScrollPositionAtom for scrollback UI
- T008 Add new types to `lib/types.ts`: ChatMessage, BreakoutRoom, HelpAlert (extended), QuizStatus (extended), LayoutConfiguration, MediaControlState, ParticipantAudioState
- T009 Add utility functions to `lib/utils.ts`: exportTranscriptAsCSV(), exportTranscriptAsJSON(), formatTimestampForExport()
- T010 [P] Create `lib/services/chat-service.ts` with sendMessage(), getMessagesForRoom(), filterMessagesByRoom() functions

So I need to:
1. Extend quiz-store.ts
2. Extend transcript-store.ts  
3. Add new types to types.ts
4. Add utility functions to utils.ts
5. Create chat-service.ts

Let me first read the existing files to understand their current state, then implement the changes.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I have all the context I need. Let me create a TODO list and start implementing tasks T006-T010.

Tasks:
- T006 [P] Extend lib/store/quiz-store.ts to add activeQuizAtom, quizHistoryAtom, quizTelemetryAtom
- T007 [P] Extend lib/store/transcript-store.ts to add transcriptScrollPositionAtom
- T008 Add new types to lib/types.ts
- T009 Add utility functions to lib/utils.ts
- T010 [P] Create lib/services/chat-service.ts

I need to create todo items for tracking, then start implementing.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I have all the context. Let me create a TODO list and start implementing tasks T006-T010.

## Plan

I'll implement these foundation tasks in Phase 3.1:
- **T006**: Extend quiz-store.ts with Jotai atoms for active quiz, history, and telemetry
- **T007**: Extend transcript-store.ts with scroll position atom
- **T008**: Add new types to types.ts (ChatMessage, BreakoutRoom extended, HelpAlert extended, etc.)
- **T009**: Add export utilities to utils.ts (CSV/JSON transcript export)
- **T010**: Create chat-service.ts with message handling functions

---

Tool use: **todo_write**

## Todo List

- [-] Extend lib/store/quiz-store.ts with activeQuizAtom, quizHistoryAtom, quizTelemetryAtom
- [ ] Extend lib/store/transcript-store.ts with transcriptScrollPositionAtom
- [ ] Add new types to lib/types.ts (ChatMessage, BreakoutRoom extended, HelpAlert extended, QuizStatus extended, LayoutConfiguration, MediaControlState, ParticipantAudioState)
- [ ] Add utility functions to lib/utils.ts (exportTranscriptAsCSV, exportTranscriptAsJSON, formatTimestampForExport)
- [ ] Create lib/services/chat-service.ts with sendMessage, getMessagesForRoom, filterMessagesByRoom

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! Now let me start with T006. I need to convert the quiz-store.ts from a class-based store to use Jotai atoms. Looking at the current implementation, it's a class-based store with Map structures. For the new atoms, I should add them alongside the existing class structure. Let me add the Jotai atoms at the end of the file.</details></think>

Excellent! All tasks T006-T010 have been completed successfully. Let me provide a summary of what was implemented.

## Summary

Successfully implemented tasks T006-T010 from Phase 3.1: Foundation. Here's what was completed:

### **T006**: Extended `lib/store/quiz-store.ts` ✅
- Added `QuizStatus` interface for lightweight quiz lifecycle metadata
- Added `QuizTelemetryEvent` interface for tracking quiz events
- Created three Jotai atoms:
  - `activeQuizAtom` - tracks currently active quiz
  - `quizHistoryAtom` - stores all quizzes from current session
  - `quizTelemetryAtom` - logs lifecycle events (created, started, ended, delivered, viewed)

### **T007**: Extended `lib/store/transcript-store.ts` ✅
- Added `transcriptScrollPositionAtom` for tracking scroll position in transcript UI
- Enables scrollback functionality and preserves scroll position during re-renders

### **T008**: Added new types to `lib/types.ts` ✅
- `MediaControlState` - tracks instructor's microphone/camera states with pending flags
- `ParticipantAudioState` - represents participant mute/unmute status for aggregate controls
- `ChatMessage` - text communication with roomId scoping (main or breakout)
- `QuizStatus` - lightweight quiz metadata (separate from full Quiz type)
- `LayoutConfiguration` - video layout preferences (grid/spotlight/custom presets)
- Enhanced `BreakoutRoom` interface with `dailyRoomUrl`, `status`, and `closedAt` fields

### **T009**: Added utility functions to `lib/utils.ts` ✅
- `formatTimestampForExport()` - converts Date to ISO 8601 format
- `exportTranscriptAsCSV()` - generates CSV with proper RFC 4180 escaping
- `exportTranscriptAsJSON()` - generates structured JSON with session metadata
- `triggerTranscriptDownload()` - browser download via Blob API
- `generateTranscriptFilename()` - standardized naming (transcript-{sessionId}-{date}.{ext})
- Helper function `escapeCsvField()` for proper CSV escaping

### **T010**: Created `lib/services/chat-service.ts` ✅
- `ChatService` class with in-memory message storage (Map<roomId, ChatMessage[]>)
- `sendMessage()` - validates and stores messages with automatic ID generation
- `getMessagesForRoom()` - retrieves all messages for a specific room
- `filterMessagesByRole()` - filters by instructor/student
- `getRecentMessages()` - pagination support (last N messages)
- `getMessagesSince()` - time-based filtering for real-time updates
- `getAllMessagesForSession()` - session-wide view for instructors
- `clear()` and `clearSession()` - cleanup methods for memory management
- Singleton export `chatService` for use in API routes

### Code Quality
- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ Comprehensive comments explaining WHY decisions were made
- ✅ Constitutional principles followed (simplicity, clear naming, educational comments)
- ✅ TypeScript types properly defined with detailed JSDoc comments
