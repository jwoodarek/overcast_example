# Check implementation across t018-t032 (2025-10-07 20:55Z)

_**User (2025-10-07 17:49Z)**_

/implement t026. I previously had chats running in parallel on t010-017, and the agen on t017 jumped ahead. these may already be implemented correctly but can you check the work across t018-t032? 

--- Cursor Command: implement.md ---
---
description: Execute the implementation plan by processing and executing all tasks defined in tasks.md
---

The user input can be provided directly by the agent or as a command argument - you **MUST** consider it before proceeding with the prompt (if not empty).

User input:

t026. I previously had chats running in parallel on t010-017, and the agen on t017 jumped ahead. these may already be implemented correctly but can you check the work across t018-t032?

1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute.

2. Load and analyze the implementation context:
   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan
   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios

3. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:
   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish
   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules
   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]
   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements

4. Execute implementation following the task plan:
   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  
   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks
   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially
   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding

5. Implementation execution rules:
   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration
   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios
   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints
   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services
   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation

6. Progress tracking and error handling:
   - Report progress after each completed task
   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails
   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones
   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging
   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed
   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.

7. Completion validation:
   - Verify all required tasks are completed
   - Check that implemented features match the original specification
   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements
   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan
   - Report final status with summary of completed work

Note: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/tasks` first to regenerate the task list.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking me to:
1. Implement task t026
2. Check the work across t018-t032 since they had parallel chats and one agent jumped ahead

Let me start by following the implement.md command instructions:

1. First, I need to run the check-prerequisites script
2. Then load and analyze the implementation context (especially tasks.md)
3. Parse the task structure
4. Execute the implementation with focus on t026 and checking t018-t032

Let me start by running the prerequisite check and reading the tasks.md file.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I've thoroughly reviewed all tasks from T018-T032, and I can confirm that **all of them are properly implemented**, including T026. Let me provide you with a summary:

## Verification Summary (T018-T032)

### ✅ Services Layer (T018-T019)
- **T018**: `AlertService` - Fully implemented with lifecycle management (acknowledge, resolve, dismiss)
- **T019**: `QuizService` - Fully implemented with LLM integration and proper error handling

### ✅ API Routes Layer (T020-T028)

- **T031**: `QuizGenerator` - Full editing interface with save/publish/discard workflow
- **T032**: `InstructorControls` - AlertPanel integrated at line 336-342

## T026 Specific Details

The PATCH endpoint for `/api/quiz/[quizId]` includes:
- ✅ Request body validation
- ✅ Quiz existence check
- ✅ Status validation (draft/published)
- ✅ Question structure validation (type, options, etc.)
- ✅ Multiple choice validation (exactly 4 options)
- ✅ Proper error responses (400, 404, 500)
- ✅ WHY comments explaining instructor review workflow
- ✅ Uses `quizService.updateQuiz()` method
- ✅ Returns updated quiz with success message

**All implementations follow the spec requirements, include educational WHY comments, and have proper error handling as required by T028.**

The work looks solid! The parallel chat that jumped ahead actually did complete the tasks correctly. All files are properly implemented according to the specifications in tasks.md.

_**Assistant (claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to implement T033. Let me check what T033 is from the tasks.md file I already have loaded.

From the tasks.md:

```
### T033: Modify Classroom Component
**File**: `app/components/Classroom.tsx`  
**Description**: Integrate transcript capture into classroom

- Initialize TranscriptionService on join
- Start capture with participant ID and role
- Handle permission requests
- Stop capture on leave
- Show opt-in notification (FERPA compliance)
- Error handling for unsupported browsers

**WHY comments**: Explain role assignment, permission flow

**Validation**: Transcripts captured during session

**Dependencies**: T016  
**Status**: [ ]
```

So I need to:
1. Read the current Classroom.tsx file
2. Integrate TranscriptionService 
3. Start capture on join, stop on leave
4. Handle permissions and errors
5. Add FERPA compliance notification
6. Add WHY comments

Let me start by reading the files I need.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Now I understand what needs to be done. I need to integrate the TranscriptionService into the Classroom component to:

1. Start capture when user joins the classroom
2. Stop capture when user leaves
3. Handle permission requests
4. Show opt-in notification (FERPA compliance)
5. Error handling for unsupported browsers

Let me modify the Classroom.tsx file to add this integration. I'll need to:
1. Import the transcriptionService
2. Add state for transcription (active, permission, error)
3. Add a FERPA consent notification component
4. Start capture in the joinRoom effect (after joined-meeting event)
5. Stop capture in handleLeave
6. Handle errors gracefully

Let me write the updated Classroom.tsx with these changes.</details></think>

Now I'll integrate the TranscriptionService into the Classroom component. I need to:
1. Start transcript capture when joining
2. Stop capture when leaving
3. Handle permissions and browser support
4. Add FERPA compliance notification
5. Add proper WHY comments

Excellent! T033 is now complete. Here's what was implemented:

## T033 Implementation Summary: Transcript Capture Integration

### Changes Made to `app/components/Classroom.tsx`

**1. Added Imports**
- Imported `transcriptionService` from `@/lib/services/transcription-service`

**2. Created FERPA Compliance Notification Component**
- `TranscriptionConsentNotification` component that displays after joining
- Explains transcription features (help detection, quiz generation)
- Provides opt-in/opt-out buttons
- Clear privacy disclosure about session-only transcription

**3. Added Transcription State Management**
- `transcriptionActive` - tracks if transcription is running
- `transcriptionSupported` - checks browser compatibility
- `transcriptionError` - captures error messages
- `showTranscriptionConsent` - controls consent notification display

**4. Implemented Transcription Functions**
- **`startTranscription()`** - Starts capturing speech with proper role assignment
  - Uses classroom ID as session ID
  - Passes user's role (instructor/student) for filtering
  - Handles errors gracefully (permissions, browser support)
  
- **`stopTranscription()`** - Stops capture and cleans up resources
  - Prevents memory leaks
  - Stops microphone usage

- **`handleTranscriptionConsent()`** - Processes user consent
  - Starts transcription if accepted
  - Records decline if rejected

**5. Integrated with Daily.co Flow**
- **On Join**: Shows consent notification 2 seconds after successful connection
- **On Leave**: Stops transcription before leaving classroom
- **Support Check**: Verifies Web Speech API availability on mount

**6. Added Visual Indicators**
- **Active Indicator**: Red badge with pulsing dot when transcription is running
- **Error Indicator**: Yellow badge showing transcription errors
- **Positioned**: Top-right corner, non-intrusive

### Key Features Implemented

✅ **Role-Based Capture**: Properly assigns instructor vs student role for quiz generation filtering  
✅ **FERPA Compliance**: Informed consent notification before capturing speech  
✅ **Permission Handling**: Graceful error handling for microphone permissions  
✅ **Browser Support**: Detects and warns about unsupported browsers (Firefox)  
✅ **Cleanup**: Proper resource cleanup on leave to prevent memory leaks  
✅ **User Transparency**: Clear indicators showing when transcription is active  
✅ **WHY Comments**: Educational comments explaining role assignment and permission flow  

### Validation
- Transcripts will be captured when users speak in the classroom
- Speech is stored in `transcriptStore` with proper metadata (role, timestamp, confidence)
- Transcripts can be retrieved via `/api/transcripts/[sessionId]`
- Help detection can analyze student transcripts for confusion
- Quiz generation can use instructor transcripts for question creation

The implementation follows all requirements from T033 and integrates seamlessly with the existing classroom flow!
