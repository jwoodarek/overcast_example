The user input can be provided directly by the agent or as a command argument - you **MUST** consider it before proceeding with the prompt (if not empty).

User input:

t008

1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute.

2. Load and analyze the implementation context:
   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan
   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios

3. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:
   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish
   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules
   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]
   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements

4. Execute implementation following the task plan:
   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  
   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks
   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially
   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding

5. Implementation execution rules:
   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration
   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios
   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints
   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services
   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation

6. Progress tracking and error handling:
   - Report progress after each completed task
   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails
   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones
   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging
   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed
   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.

7. Completion validation:
   - Verify all required tasks are completed
   - Check that implemented features match the original specification
   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements
   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan
   - Report final status with summary of completed work

Note: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/tasks` first to regenerate the task list.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to implement task T008 from their tasks.md file. Let me follow the implementation command instructions:

1. First, I need to run the check-prerequisites script to get the FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS
2. Then load and analyze the implementation context by reading the relevant files
3. Parse the tasks.md structure to find T008
4. Execute the specific task

Let me start by running the prerequisites check script.</details></think>

---

I'll implement task T008 following the structured approach. Let me start by checking prerequisites and loading the implementation context.

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
cd /Users/jedwoodarek/Projects/overcast_example && .specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good, now I have a complete understanding of the context. Looking at the tasks.md file, T008 is:

### T008: Export Store Singletons
**File**: `lib/store/index.ts`  
**Description**: Create singleton instances and export with cleanup interval

```typescript
export const transcriptStore = new TranscriptStore();
export const alertStore = new AlertStore();
export const quizStore = new QuizStore();

// Auto-dismiss old alerts every 5 minutes
setInterval(() => alertStore.autoDismissOld(), 5 * 60 * 1000);
```

**WHY comment**: Explain singleton pattern for shared state across API routes

**Validation**: Can import stores in other files

**Dependencies**: T005, T006, T007  
**Status**: [ ]

According to the tasks, T005, T006, and T007 are already marked as [X] completed, so the dependencies are satisfied. 

I need to:
1. Create the file `lib/store/index.ts`
2. Import the three store classes
3. Export singleton instances
4. Add the auto-dismiss interval
5. Add WHY comments
6. Mark the task as complete in tasks.md

Let me do this now.</details></think>

---

Perfect! Now I have all the context. Let me implement **T008: Export Store Singletons**.

## Plan

T008 creates `lib/store/index.ts` which:
1. Imports the three store classes (TranscriptStore, AlertStore, QuizStore)
2. Creates and exports singleton instances
3. Sets up a cleanup interval for auto-dismissing old alerts
4. Includes WHY comments explaining the singleton pattern

Dependencies T005-T007 are already complete, so I can proceed.

## Implementation

Excellent! T008 is now complete. Let me provide a summary:

## Summary

**Task T008: Export Store Singletons** has been successfully implemented.

### What was created:

**File**: `lib/store/index.ts`

This file exports singleton instances of the three in-memory stores that will be shared across all API routes:

1. **`transcriptStore`** - Stores speech-to-text entries during active sessions
2. **`alertStore`** - Tracks help requests and their status
3. **`quizStore`** - Stores AI-generated quizzes

### Key features:

- **Singleton pattern**: Ensures shared state across all API routes and components
- **Auto-cleanup**: Runs every 5 minutes to auto-dismiss alerts older than 30 minutes
- **Educational comments**: Extensive WHY comments explain:
  - Why singletons are used (shared state across API routes)
  - Why in-memory stores (MVP approach, simple, fast)
  - Lifecycle management (server runtime only, cleared on session end)
  - Auto-dismissal rationale (prevents alert overflow)

### Validation:

âœ… TypeScript compilation passes (all imports resolve correctly)  
âœ… No linter errors  
âœ… Can be imported by other files (`import { transcriptStore, alertStore, quizStore } from '@/lib/store'`)  
âœ… Task marked as complete in tasks.md

The stores are now ready to be used by API routes and services in the next phase of implementation.

_**Assistant (claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to implement task T009. Let me follow the structured approach:

1. First, I should run the prerequisites check
2. Load the implementation context (I already have most of this from the previous task)
3. Parse tasks.md to understand T009 specifically
4. Implement T009
5. Mark it as complete

Looking at the tasks.md file I already read, T009 is:

```
### T009: Add Alert Constants
**File**: `lib/constants.ts`  
**Description**: Add help detection keywords and thresholds

From research.md, add:
- `HELP_KEYWORDS` array with categories (direct help, confusion, frustration)
- `URGENCY_THRESHOLDS` for scoring algorithm
- `FALSE_POSITIVE_PHRASES` to filter out
- `DEFAULT_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.7`
- `ALERT_AUTO_DISMISS_MINUTES = 30`

**WHY comments**: Explain why these specific keywords chosen

**Validation**: Constants exported and typed correctly

**Dependencies**: T004  
**Status**: [ ]
```

So I need to:
1. Read the existing lib/constants.ts file to see what's already there
2. Add the alert-related constants based on research.md
3. Add WHY comments explaining the choices
4. Ensure TypeScript types are correct
5. Validate and mark complete</details></think>

## Summary

**Task T009: Add Alert Constants** has been successfully implemented.

### What was added to `lib/constants.ts`:

1. **`HELP_KEYWORDS`** - Categorized keywords for detecting when students need help:
   - **Direct help**: Explicit requests like "I need help", "I'm stuck" (7 phrases)
   - **Confusion**: Indicators like "I'm lost", "I don't get it" (8 phrases)
   - **Frustration**: Urgent signals like "I give up", "this is too hard" (6 phrases)

2. **`FALSE_POSITIVE_PHRASES`** - Filter to prevent misclassification:
   - Phrases like "I understand", "that makes sense" (8 phrases)
   - Prevents positive statements from triggering alerts

3. **`URGENCY_THRESHOLDS`** - Scoring system for prioritization:
   - Low (1): Single confusion keyword
   - Medium (2): Direct help request or multiple confusion keywords
   - High (3): Frustration keyword or repeated help requests

4. **`DEFAULT_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`** = 0.7
   - Filters low-quality transcripts from speech recognition
   - Balances accuracy with coverage

5. **`ALERT_AUTO_DISMISS_MINUTES`** = 30
   - Alerts auto-dismiss after 30 minutes if unacknowledged
   - Prevents stale alerts from accumulating

### Key features:

- **Educational comments**: Extensive WHY documentation explaining:
  - Research basis for keyword selection
  - Rationale for threshold values
  - Scoring algorithm details
  - Tuning recommendations

- **TypeScript types**: All constants use `as const` for type safety
