TITLE: daily-js Constructor Options
DESCRIPTION: Demonstrates how to configure the daily-js library during instantiation, focusing on upcoming changes to multiple call instance handling and CSP compatibility.

SOURCE: https://github.com/daily-co/daily-js/blob/daily-js-releases/README.md

LANGUAGE: javascript
CODE:
```
const call = new DailyCall({
  // For older versions, strictMode: false allowed multiple instances.
  // In future versions, this will be replaced by allowMultipleCallInstances: true.
  // strictMode: false, 
  
  // To opt-in to multiple call instances in future versions:
  // allowMultipleCallInstances: true,

  // To prepare for avoidEval becoming true by default:
  // dailyConfig: {
  //   avoidEval: true
  // }
});
```

--------------------------------

TITLE: daily-js Configuration Options Reference
DESCRIPTION: Details key configuration parameters for the DailyCall constructor, including strictMode, allowMultipleCallInstances, and avoidEval, along with their behavior and implications.

SOURCE: https://github.com/daily-co/daily-js/blob/daily-js-releases/README.md

LANGUAGE: APIDOC
CODE:
```
DailyCall Constructor Options:

  strictMode: boolean (defaults to true)
    - Controls whether the library throws an Error when attempting to use a Daily call instance after it has been destroyed.
    - If true, an Error is thrown. If false, the instance can still be used (though this is discouraged).

  allowMultipleCallInstances: boolean (defaults to false in upcoming versions)
    - Controls whether the application is allowed to create multiple DailyCall instances simultaneously.
    - If true, multiple instances are permitted. If false, creating a second or subsequent instance will throw an Error.
    - In older versions, `strictMode: false` was used to circumvent this limitation.

  dailyConfig: object
    - An object for advanced configuration.
    - avoidEval: boolean (defaults to true in upcoming versions)
      - Enables CSP-friendly behavior by avoiding the use of `eval()`.
      - If true, the library uses alternative methods. If false, `eval()` may be used.
      - To ensure CSP compliance, ensure your `script-src` directive includes `https://*.daily.co` or explicitly set `avoidEval: false` if needed.
```

TITLE: Daily.js Basic Hello World Example
DESCRIPTION: This snippet demonstrates the fundamental usage of the Daily.js library. It initializes a new Daily instance and calls the sayHello method, updating a DOM element with the returned string. Ensure the Daily library is loaded in the window context.

SOURCE: https://github.com/daily-co/daily-js/blob/daily-js-releases/test/basic-script.html

LANGUAGE: javascript
CODE:
```
function run() { 
  let daily = new window.Daily(); 
  document.getElementById('rplx').innerText = daily.sayHello(); 
}
```

--------------------------------

TITLE: Serve HTML for ES6 Module Testing
DESCRIPTION: Explains how to test ES6 module imports in the browser. Since loading `type=module` scripts from `file://` URLs is restricted, a local server is required. This snippet provides the command to start a local server using `npx serve`.

SOURCE: https://github.com/daily-co/daily-js/blob/daily-js-releases/test/README.md

LANGUAGE: bash
CODE:
```
npx serve
```

--------------------------------

TITLE: Initialize and Use Daily.js
DESCRIPTION: This snippet demonstrates how to import the Daily library from a local path, create a new instance of the Daily class, and call its sayHello method. The result is then displayed in an HTML element with the ID 'rplx'.

SOURCE: https://github.com/daily-co/daily-js/blob/daily-js-releases/test/module-script.html

LANGUAGE: javascript
CODE:
```
import Daily from '../dist/daily-esm.js';

let daily = new Daily();
document.getElementById('rplx').innerText = daily.sayHello();
```

--------------------------------

TITLE: Run Node.js CommonJS Module
DESCRIPTION: Demonstrates loading the Daily.js library using a standard Node.js CommonJS module `require` statement. This snippet shows the command to execute the test file.

SOURCE: https://github.com/daily-co/daily-js/blob/daily-js-releases/test/README.md

LANGUAGE: bash
CODE:

LANGUAGE: bash
CODE:
```
babel-node --plugins transform-es2015-modules-commonjs test/basic-import.js
```

--------------------------------

TITLE: Run Node.js Experimental ES6 Module
DESCRIPTION: Utilizes Node.js's experimental module loader for ES6 `import` statements. This requires the file to have an `.mjs` extension. The snippet shows the command to run the module with the experimental flag enabled.

SOURCE: https://github.com/daily-co/daily-js/blob/daily-js-releases/test/README.md

LANGUAGE: bash
CODE:
```
node --experimental-modules test/node-import.mjs
```

_**Assistant (claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking me to review the repository and the updated documentation for daily-js. They explicitly said "don't do anything yet", so I should just provide an analysis without making any changes.

Let me break down what I need to do:
1. Review the current repository structure and understand what it's doing
2. Review the provided daily-js documentation snippets
3. Identify any potential issues or areas where the code might need updates based on the new documentation

Let me first understand the repository structure and read key files to understand what this project does.

From the project layout, I can see:
- This appears to be a Next.js application
- It has components for Classroom, Lobby, VideoFeed, ParticipantList, InstructorControls
- There are API routes for rooms and participants
- It has tests (contract, integration, unit)
- There's a specs directory with documentation

The daily-js documentation snippets are highlighting:
1. Constructor options changes (strictMode → allowMultipleCallInstances)
2. CSP compatibility with avoidEval option
3. Various ways to import/use the library

I should read the key files that likely use daily-js to understand how it's currently configured.</details></think>

---

I'll review the repository structure and compare it against the updated daily-js documentation to identify potential issues or needed updates.

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the repository and the new daily-js documentation. Let me compile my analysis:

## Current State Analysis

1. **Daily.js version**: The project is using `@daily-co/daily-js: ^0.84.0`

2. **Current Daily instantiation** (lines 446-453 in Classroom.tsx):
```typescript
const Daily = (await import('@daily-co/daily-js')).default;
const call = Daily.createCallObject({
  audioSource: true,
  videoSource: true
});
```

3. **No constructor options set**: The code is not currently passing any of the new configuration options like `strictMode`, `allowMultipleCallInstances`, or `dailyConfig.avoidEval`.

4. **Singleton pattern**: The code implements a module-level singleton to prevent duplicate Daily instances, which is specifically done to handle React strict mode double-mounting.

5. **CSP configuration**: The vercel.json file doesn't currently define a Content-Security-Policy header with script-src directives.

## Issues and Concerns Based on New Documentation

### 1. **Multiple Call Instances**
- **Current approach**: Using a module-level singleton (`dailyCallSingleton`) to prevent multiple instances
- **New docs**: In future versions of daily-js, `strictMode` (defaults to `true`) will prevent multiple instances. The code will need to explicitly set `allowMultipleCallInstances: true` if it needs multiple instances (which it doesn't currently want)
- **Impact**: The current singleton pattern aligns with the future default behavior, but the implementation might become cleaner by relying on daily-js's built-in protection

### 2. **CSP Compatibility (avoidEval)**
- **Current state**: No explicit `avoidEval` setting, no CSP headers with script-src
- **New docs**: In future versions, `avoidEval` will default to `true`, requiring CSP headers to include `script-src https://*.daily.co`


- **Impact**: 
  - If `avoidEval` becomes true by default, the app needs to add CSP headers
  - Alternatively, explicitly set `avoidEval: false` to maintain current behavior
  - Best practice: Opt into CSP-friendly mode now and add proper CSP headers

### 3. **StrictMode Behavior**
- **Current state**: No explicit `strictMode` setting
- **New docs**: `strictMode` defaults to `true`, which throws errors when using a destroyed call instance
- **Impact**: The current code has proper cleanup logic, so this should be fine, but it's worth noting

## Recommendations

The project needs proactive configuration updates to align with upcoming daily-js changes. Key actions include implementing CSP headers, potentially adjusting `avoidEval` settings, and ensuring compatibility with stricter instantiation rules. Careful testing will be crucial to maintain current functionality while adopting new best practices.

I'll prepare for future compliance by configuring explicit settings that anticipate framework updates. This means adding specific configuration options that demonstrate intentional security and performance considerations.

Implementing these recommendations will help prevent potential runtime issues and position the application for smoother future upgrades. The goal is to be ahead of potential breaking changes while maintaining existing functionality.

Proactively documenting version-specific behaviors ensures clear communication about configuration choices and upcoming framework modifications.</details></think>

## Repository Analysis & Daily.js Documentation Review

### **Project Overview**
This is an Overcast Video Classroom application built with Next.js 15.5.4 and Daily.co. It provides a lobby with 6 classrooms where students and instructors can join live video sessions. Currently using:
- `@daily-co/daily-js: ^0.84.0`
- `@daily-co/daily-react: ^0.23.2`

### **Current Daily.js Implementation**

**Location**: `app/components/Classroom.tsx` (lines 446-453)

The app creates Daily call objects like this:
```typescript
const Daily = (await import('@daily-co/daily-js')).default;
const call = Daily.createCallObject({
  audioSource: true,
  videoSource: true
});
```

**Key architectural decision**: Uses a module-level singleton pattern to prevent duplicate Daily instances, specifically to handle React Strict Mode's double-mounting behavior.

---

## **Critical Findings & Recommendations**

### **1. Multiple Call Instances - Currently Aligned ✅**

**Status**: Your singleton pattern aligns well with daily-js's future direction

**What the docs say**: 
- Future versions will default to preventing multiple instances (via `strictMode: true`)
- Old approach: `strictMode: false` allowed multiple instances
- New approach: `allowMultipleCallInstances: true` to explicitly opt-in

**Your implementation**: You're actively preventing multiple instances with `dailyCallSingleton`, which matches the future default behavior.

**Recommendation**: 
- Consider adding an explicit comment that future daily-js versions will enforce this by default
- When updating daily-js in the future, you may be able to remove the singleton pattern and rely on the library's built-in protection

---

### **2. CSP Compatibility - Needs Attention ⚠️**

**Status**: Not currently configured for CSP, but should be prepared for upcoming `avoidEval: true` default

**What the docs say**:
- In upcoming versions, `avoidEval` will default to `true` for CSP-friendly behavior
- When `avoidEval: true`, you need `script-src` CSP headers to include `https://*.daily.co`
- Without proper CSP headers, video functionality could break

**Your current state**:
- No `avoidEval` configuration in `createCallObject`
- `vercel.json` has security headers but **no Content-Security-Policy** with `script-src` directives
- Currently relying on daily-js's old default behavior (uses `eval()`)

**Recommendations**:
1. **Add CSP headers to `vercel.json`** to support Daily.co:
   ```json
   {
     "key": "Content-Security-Policy",
     "value": "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://*.daily.co; frame-src https://*.daily.co; connect-src https://*.daily.co wss://*.daily.co"
   }
   ```

2. **Explicitly opt into CSP-friendly mode** in `Classroom.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   const call = Daily.createCallObject({
     audioSource: true,
     videoSource: true,
     dailyConfig: {
       avoidEval: true // Prepare for future default
     }
   });
   ```

3. **Test thoroughly** after these changes to ensure video still works

---

### **3. StrictMode Configuration - Currently Fine ✅**

**Status**: Your cleanup logic is solid

**What the docs say**:
- `strictMode: true` (default) throws errors when using a destroyed call instance
- `strictMode: false` allows using destroyed instances (discouraged)

**Your implementation**: Your code has proper cleanup in the `safelyLeaveCall` utility and destroys the singleton properly when leaving classrooms.

**Recommendation**: No action needed, but you could add explicit `strictMode: true` for documentation purposes.

---

### **4. X-Frame-Options Conflict ⚠️**

**Issue spotted**: In `vercel.json` line 39, you have:
```json
"X-Frame-Options": "DENY"
```

This might conflict with Daily.co's iframe-based video implementation. Daily needs to embed iframes for video calls.

**Recommendation**: Change to:
```json
"X-Frame-Options": "SAMEORIGIN"
```
Or better yet, use the more flexible `frame-ancestors` CSP directive instead.

---

## **Action Plan**

### **Immediate (Prepare for future daily-js versions)**:

1. **Update `vercel.json`** to add CSP headers that support Daily.co
2. **Update `Classroom.tsx`** to include `dailyConfig: { avoidEval: true }`
3. **Fix X-Frame-Options** to allow iframe embedding
4. **Add explanatory comments** following your project's philosophy of explaining WHY

### **When updating daily-js to newer versions**:

1. Check release notes for breaking changes related to `strictMode` and `allowMultipleCallInstances`
2. Consider removing custom singleton pattern if the library enforces it
3. Test CSP compliance thoroughly

---

## **Key Architectural Notes**

Your project follows excellent principles:
- ✅ Well-commented code explaining WHY decisions were made
- ✅ Centralized error handling in `lib/daily-utils.ts`
- ✅ Proper cleanup and singleton management
- ✅ Beginner-friendly structure

The daily-js changes are mostly about being explicit with configuration options that were previously implicit. Your current architecture is sound and just needs CSP preparation.

_**User (2025-10-07 17:19Z)**_

okay i'm trying to install spec-kit with this command but it's failing:

uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git

---

_**Assistant (claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is trying to install spec-kit (specify-cli) using uv tool install command, but it's failing. This is completely unrelated to the daily-js documentation review I just did. They're asking for help with a different issue.

Let me help them troubleshoot this installation issue. The command they're using is:
```
uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git
```

A few potential issues:
1. The syntax might be wrong for uv tool install
2. The repository URL might be incorrect
3. The package name might not match
4. There could be authentication issues with GitHub
5. The spec-kit repository might not exist at that location or might be private

I should ask for the error message to help diagnose, but I can also try to search for information about spec-kit and the correct installation method.</details></think>

---

I need to see the actual error message to diagnose the issue properly. Can you share the error output you're getting?

In the meantime, here are some common issues with that command:

## **Potential Issues**

### **1. Repository doesn't exist / is private**
The repository `github/spec-kit` might not exist publicly or could be private. Let me search for the correct repository.

### **2. Incorrect uv syntax**
The `uv tool install` syntax for git repositories might need adjustment. Try:

```bash
# Option 1: Using pip-style git URL
uv tool install git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git

# Option 2: If the package has a different name
uv pip install git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git

# Option 3: Clone and install locally
git clone https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git
cd spec-kit
uv pip install -e .
```

### **3. Authentication required**
If the repo is private, you might need authentication:

```bash
# With GitHub token
uv tool install git+https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/github/spec-kit.git

# Or use SSH
uv tool install git+ssh://git@github.com/github/spec-kit.git
```

### **4. Wrong repository**
Check if spec-kit/specify-cli is:
- Under a different GitHub organization
- Has a different repository name
- Is distributed through PyPI instead: `uv tool install specify-cli`

**Please share the error message** and I can give you a more specific solution. The error will tell us whether it's:
- A network/authentication issue
- A syntax problem
- A package not found issue
- A dependency conflict

_**User (2025-10-07 17:19Z)**_

i got a uv command does not exist. can you run the commands for me?

---

_**Assistant (claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking me to run commands for them, but they're getting "uv command does not exist" error. This means `uv` (a Python package manager) is not installed on their system.

I should:
1. Check if uv is installed
2. If not, help them install it
3. Then try to install spec-kit/specify-cli

Let me start by checking what's available on their system and trying to find the correct way to install spec-kit.</details></think>

| Title | URL | Chunk |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Web Search Results |  | It appears you're encountering an issue because the `uv` command is not recognized on your system. `uv` is a modern Python package manager that offers efficient dependency management and is often used in conjunction with tools like `specify-cli`. To resolve this, let's proceed with the following steps:<br/><br/>**1. Install `uv`:**<br/><br/>To install `uv`, you can use the following command:<br/><br/><br/>```bash<br/>curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh \| sh<br/>```<br/><br/><br/>This command downloads and executes the installation script for `uv`. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to install software on your system.<br/><br/>**2. Verify the Installation:**<br/><br/>After installation, confirm that `uv` is correctly installed by checking its version:<br/><br/><br/>```bash<br/>uv --version<br/>```<br/><br/><br/>This should display the installed version of `uv`, indicating a successful installation.<br/><br/>**3. Install `specify-cli` Using `uv`:**<br/><br/>With `uv` installed, you can now install `specify-cli` from the `spec-kit` repository. Use the following command:<br/><br/><br/>```bash<br/>uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git<br/>```<br/><br/><br/>This command tells `uv` to install the `specify-cli` tool directly from the specified GitHub repository.<br/><br/>**4. Initialize a New Project with `specify-cli`:**<br/><br/>Once `specify-cli` is installed, you can initialize a new project using the following command:<br/><br/><br/>```bash<br/>uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init <PROJECT_NAME><br/>```<br/><br/><br/>Replace `<PROJECT_NAME>` with your desired project name. This command sets up a new project using the templates and configurations provided by `spec-kit`.<br/><br/>**Additional Considerations:**<br/><br/>- **Prerequisites:** Ensure that you have Python 3.11 or later and Git installed on your system, as these are required for `spec-kit` to function properly.<br/><br/>- **AI Coding Agent:** `spec-kit` supports various AI coding agents like Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and Gemini CLI. You can specify your preferred agent during initialization.<br/><br/>- **Script Type Configuration:** Depending on your operating system, `spec-kit` generates both Bash (`.sh`) and PowerShell (`.ps1`) scripts. You can specify the script type during initialization if needed.<br/><br/>For more detailed information and troubleshooting, refer to the [Spec Kit Installation Guide](https://github.github.com/spec-kit/installation.html).<br/><br/>By following these steps, you should be able to install `uv`, set up `specify-cli`, and initialize your project successfully. |

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to run commands for them. I don't have a tool to execute arbitrary shell commands in their terminal, but I can check if certain things exist. However, I cannot directly run installation commands.

Let me check what tools are available in their environment and see if I can help them understand what needs to be done.

Actually, looking at the available tools, I don't have a "run command" or "terminal" tool. I should explain that I can't directly run shell commands, but I can help them with the commands they need to run.

However, given their request and the context that they're a beginner, I should be direct and helpful without over-explaining limitations.</details></think>

---

I don't have the ability to run shell commands directly in your terminal, but I can guide you through the exact commands you need to run. Here's what you need to do:

## **Step 1: Install `uv` (Python package manager)**

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Then restart your terminal or run:
```bash
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

Verify it's installed:
```bash
uv --version
```

## **Step 2: Install spec-kit/specify-cli**

Once `uv` is installed, run:

```bash
uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git
```

## **Alternative: Use `pip` or `pipx` (if you prefer not to install uv)**

If you already have Python and pip installed, you can try:

```bash
# Using pip
pip install git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git

# Or using pipx (if installed)
pipx install git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git
```

---

**Quick question**: What are you trying to use spec-kit for with this project? Understanding your goal will help me provide better guidance on whether you actually need it, or if there's a simpler approach for what you're trying to accomplish with the Overcast classroom app.

_**User (2025-10-07 17:19Z)**_

am i able to input terminal commands in cursor? 

---

_**Assistant (claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking if they can input terminal commands in Cursor. They want to know if there's a way to run terminal commands from within the Cursor IDE.

The answer is yes - Cursor has a built-in terminal. I should explain how to access and use it. However, I should be clear that I (the AI assistant) cannot directly execute commands in their terminal - they need to run the commands themselves in Cursor's terminal.

Let me provide a helpful, concise answer about how to use the terminal in Cursor.</details></think>

---

Yes! Cursor has a built-in terminal. Here's how to access it:

## **Opening the Terminal in Cursor**

**Method 1: Keyboard Shortcut**
- Mac: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>`</kbd> (backtick)
- Or: <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd>

**Method 2: Menu**
- Top menu: `Terminal` → `New Terminal`
- Or: `View` → `Terminal`

**Method 3: Command Palette**
- Mac: <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>
- Type: "Terminal: Create New Terminal"

---

Once you have the terminal open, you can run the commands I mentioned:

```bash
# First, install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Then restart the terminal or source the env
source $HOME/.cargo/env

# Verify uv is installed
uv --version

# Finally, install spec-kit
uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git
```

The terminal in Cursor works just like any other terminal - you can run npm commands, git commands, build scripts, etc. It's already set to your workspace directory (`/Users/jedwoodarek/Projects/overcast_example`).

**Note**: While I can see your project files and help you with code, I cannot directly execute commands in your terminal - you'll need to copy/paste and run them yourself.

---

_**User (2025-10-07 17:19Z)**_

can you see my terminal? do i use sh or ps? 

---

_**Assistant (claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking if I can see their terminal and whether they should use sh (bash) or ps (PowerShell) scripts.

From the user_info I received earlier:
```
OS Version: darwin 24.5.0
Shell: /bin/zsh
```

Darwin is macOS, so they're on a Mac using zsh (Z shell). They should use sh/bash scripts, not PowerShell (which is for Windows).

I cannot see their terminal output - I can only see files in the workspace and git status, but not live terminal sessions.</details></think>

---

No, I cannot see your terminal or its output. I can only see:
- Files in your workspace
- Git status
- Code you share with me

However, **I can tell you what shell you're using** from the session info:

## **Your System Info**
- **OS**: macOS (darwin 24.5.0)
- **Shell**: `/bin/zsh` (Z shell)

## **Use `.sh` (Bash/Shell scripts)**

Since you're on **macOS with zsh**, you should use:
- ✅ **`.sh`** scripts (bash/shell scripts)
- ✅ Standard Unix/Linux commands
- ❌ **NOT** `.ps1` (PowerShell - that's for Windows)

So when you run the uv installation command, use:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

This will work perfectly in your zsh terminal on Mac.

---

**After you run commands**, if you want me to help troubleshoot:
1. Copy the terminal output (errors, messages, etc.)
2. Paste it in your message to me
3. I can then help you understand what happened

For example, if the uv installation fails, copy the error message and share it with me so I can help debug.

how do i get out of a terminal command when it says quote>

---

_**Assistant (claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is seeing `quote>` in their terminal. This means they have an unclosed quote - they started a string with a quote character (either single ' or double ") but didn't close it, so the shell is waiting for them to complete the string.

The solution is to press Ctrl+C to cancel the command, or they could close the quote if they want to complete it.</details></think>

---

You have an **unclosed quote**! The terminal is waiting for you to close a quote that you started.

## **Quick Fix**

Press: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>

This will cancel the command and return you to a normal prompt.

---

## **Why This Happens**

You likely typed a command with an opening quote (`'` or `"`) but didn't close it. For example:

```bash
# Missing closing quote
echo "hello
quote>
```

The `quote>` prompt means the shell is waiting for you to finish the string.

## **Solutions**

**Option 1: Cancel it** (Recommended)
```
Ctrl + C
```

**Option 2: Complete the quote** (if you want to finish the command)
Type the closing quote and press Enter:
```
quote> "
```

---

After you press Ctrl+C, you'll be back to your normal prompt and can start fresh. Try typing the command again, making sure all quotes are properly closed:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Let me know if you need help with the command you were trying to run!

/speckit.constitution This is a working zoom alternative using the daily js api. I need to get it running locally on my machine by seeting up my env variables and my api key. My goal is to create features that make this a groundbreaking education video platform with features like analyzing transcripts and chats in breakout rooms to alert the instructor when help is needed (given the instructor a heads up on what theyre struggling with). Features like creating pop quiz questions based on the transcript from the instructor (only the instructor) and more

sh: no matches found: (given the instructor a heads up on what theyre struggling with).

can you help me fix my terminal prompt?

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user has an issue with their terminal prompt. Looking at the error:

```
sh: no matches found: (given the instructor a heads up on what theyre struggling with).
```

This error happens when the shell is trying to interpret parentheses as glob patterns. The user typed a command that started with `/speckit.constitution` and then a long description with parentheses.

The issue is that they typed this whole thing as a command in the terminal. It looks like they were trying to use a spec-kit command or maybe just describing their project, but the shell interpreted it as a command.

The parentheses `(given the instructor a heads up on what theyre struggling with)` were treated as a glob pattern by the shell, and since there's no file matching that pattern, it gave the error "no matches found".

They need to:
1. Just press Enter or Ctrl+C to clear this
2. Understand what they should actually be doing

Looking at their goal: They want to get the Overcast classroom app running locally by setting up environment variables and Daily.co API key. That's what we should focus on, not spec-kit for now.</details></think>

---

The error is happening because you typed that whole description directly into the terminal as a command! The shell is trying to interpret the parentheses `()` as special characters.

## **Quick Fix**

Just press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to clear the error and get back to a normal prompt.

---

## **What Happened**

You typed `/speckit.constitution This is a working zoom alternative...` directly into the terminal. The shell tried to execute this as a command and got confused by the parentheses.

---

## **Let's Focus on Your Actual Goal**

Based on what you wrote, you want to:
1. ✅ Get the Overcast classroom app running locally
2. ✅ Set up environment variables
3. ✅ Configure your Daily.co API key
4. 🎯 Eventually add AI features (transcript analysis, auto-quizzes, etc.)

**Let's do that instead!** Here's the plan:

### **Step 1: Get Your Daily.co API Key**

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: /Users/jedwoodarek/Projects/overcast_example/env.example

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good, I have the env.example file. Now I need to guide them through setting up their environment.</details></think>

---

Perfect! Now let's get your app running. In your terminal, run these commands:

### **Step 2: Create Your Environment File**

```bash
cp env.example .env.local
```

### **Step 3: Get Your Daily.co API Key**

1. Go to: https://dashboard.daily.co/developers
2. Sign up or log in
3. Copy your API key
4. Create 6 room URLs (or use the default ones)

### **Step 4: Edit Your .env.local File**

Open the `.env.local` file you just created and replace `your_daily_api_key_here` with your actual API key.

Want me to open the file for you so you can edit it? Or would you prefer step-by-step instructions?

### **Step 5: Install Dependencies and Run**

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser!

---

**About spec-kit**: You don't actually need spec-kit to run this app. Spec-kit is a project management tool. Your app is already built and ready to run - you just need the Daily.co credentials!

**Your AI features idea is excellent** - once we get the basic app running, we can work on adding transcript analysis, auto-quiz generation, and breakout room monitoring. Those will be awesome additions!

Want to proceed with getting the app running first?

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is trying to use a `/constitution` command, which appears to be part of a spec-kit or SpecStory workflow. They've shared their project goals and now the command is asking me to create/update a constitution file.

However, I can see from the git status that `.specify/memory/constitution.md` was deleted:
```
deleted:    .specify/memory/constitution.md
```

And all the other `.specify/` files were also deleted. So the constitution template doesn't exist anymore.

The user's goals are clear:
1. Get the app running locally (env setup, API keys)
2. Add AI-powered education features:
   - Transcript analysis in breakout rooms
   - Alert instructor when students need help
   - Auto-generate quiz questions from instructor transcripts
   - More educational enhancements

I need to:
1. Check if the constitution file exists
2. If not, I should inform the user that the spec-kit files were deleted
3. Help them understand what they actually need - which is to just get the app running, not necessarily recreate the constitution

Let me check what's in the .specify directory first.</details></think>

---

I see you're trying to use the `/constitution` command from spec-kit/SpecStory. However, I can see from your git status that the `.specify/` directory files were deleted:

```
deleted:    .specify/memory/constitution.md
deleted:    .specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh
deleted:    .specify/scripts/bash/common.sh
deleted:    .specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh
deleted:    .specify/scripts/bash/setup-plan.sh
deleted:    .specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh
deleted:    .specify/templates/agent-file-template.md
deleted:    .specify/templates/plan-template.md
deleted:    .specify/templates/spec-template.md
deleted:    .specify/templates/tasks-template.md
```

Tool use: **list_dir**

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory undefined • **0** results</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The `.specify/` directory doesn't exist anymore - it was deleted. The user is trying to use spec-kit commands but the infrastructure isn't there.

I should help them understand:
1. The spec-kit files were removed
2. They don't actually need spec-kit to achieve their goals
3. Let's focus on what they actually want: getting the app running and planning the AI features

Their actual goals are pragmatic:
- Get the app running locally
- Add AI-powered educational features

Let me help them focus on that instead of the spec-kit infrastructure.</details></think>
